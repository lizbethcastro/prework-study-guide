Students learned about using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to create this Prework Study Guide. This study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript  . The webpage also contains a console which helps us decide which topic to study first. During this project, I developed some coding skills by learning about the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as well as learning how use the Git terminal command line.
